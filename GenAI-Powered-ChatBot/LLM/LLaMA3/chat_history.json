    "content": "Lily is a fictional character in the novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen. She is a secondary character in the novel and appears only once, in the second chapter of Part III, where she is described as \"smart, sly, and shrewd\". Despite her lack of screen time, Lily has become an important symbol for Austen's characters, most notably Elizabeth Bennet. Her presence in the story highlights her independence and determination, while also underscoring the importance of character development in literary fiction."
